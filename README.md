CS 2043: A student project aimed at creating a family financial tracker

This branch is dedicated to the development of a feature for our family financial tracker. The end goal is to have a view, associated controller, and some JUnit tests. Some dummy objects may be needed to drive this code and will need to be removed before merging with the Main branch.
